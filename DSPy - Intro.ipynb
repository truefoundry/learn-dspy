    "Using LMs to build a complex system we generally have to: \n",
    "- Break the problem down into steps\n",
    "- Prompt your LM well until each step works well in isolation\n",
    "- Tweak the steps to work well together\n",
    "- Generate synthetic examples to tune each step\n",
    "- Use these examples to finetune smaller LMs to cut costs.\n",

    "## How?\n",
    "DSPy breaks this process into following three abstractions:\n",
    "- **Signatures:** Abstract the input and output behaviour\n",
    "- **Modules:** Defines the flow of your program and sets up a pipeline. E.g of modules: `Predict`, `ChainOfThought`, `ProgramOfThought`, `MultiChainComparison` and `React`.\n",
    "- **Optimizers:** Also known as `Teleprompters`, it takes the program, a training set and an evaluation metric and returns a new optimized program for the required use-case. Used to train smaller LMs (student) using larger LMs (teacher).\n",

    "- Collect a little bit of data.\n",
    "- Define examples of the inputs and outputs of your program (e.g., questions and their answers). This could just be a handful of quick examples you wrote down. If large datasets exist, the more the merrier!\n",
    "- Define the modules (i.e., sub-tasks) of your program and the way they should interact together to solve your task.\n",
    "- Define some validation logic. What makes for a good run of your program? Maybe the answers need to have a certain length or stick to a particular format? Specify the logic that checks that.\n",
    "- Compile! Ask DSPy to compile your program using your data. The compiler will use your data and validation logic to optimize your program (e.g., prompts and modules) so it's efficient and effective!Iterate.\n",
