    "Using LMs to build a complex system we generally have to: \n",
    "- Break the problem down into steps\n",
    "- Prompt your LM well until each step works well in isolation\n",
    "- Tweak the steps to work well together\n",
    "- Generate synthetic examples to tune each step\n",
    "- Use these examples to finetune smaller LMs to cut costs.\n",

    "## How?\n",
    "DSPy breaks this process into following three abstractions:\n",
    "- **Signatures:** Abstract the input and output behaviour\n",
    "- **Modules:** Defines the flow of your program and sets up a pipeline. E.g of modules: `Predict`, `ChainOfThought`, `ProgramOfThought`, `MultiChainComparison` and `React`.\n",
    "- **Optimizers:** Also known as `Teleprompters`, it takes the program, a training set and an evaluation metric and returns a new optimized program for the required use-case. Used to train smaller LMs (student) using larger LMs (teacher).\n",

    "- Collect a little bit of data.\n",
    "- Define examples of the inputs and outputs of your program (e.g., questions and their answers). This could just be a handful of quick examples you wrote down. If large datasets exist, the more the merrier!\n",
    "- Define the modules (i.e., sub-tasks) of your program and the way they should interact together to solve your task.\n",
    "- Define some validation logic. What makes for a good run of your program? Maybe the answers need to have a certain length or stick to a particular format? Specify the logic that checks that.\n",
    "- Compile! Ask DSPy to compile your program using your data. The compiler will use your data and validation logic to optimize your program (e.g., prompts and modules) so it's efficient and effective!Iterate.\n",

      "Answer: Here's an explanation of the main types of storage classes:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stack**: A stack follows the LIFO principle, where data is added to and removed from one end only. This means that when you add a new element (like a plate), it goes on top, and when you remove an element, it comes off last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: Think about stacking plates - each time you put down another plate, it gets stacked on the previous ones. When serving dinner, we take them out in reverse order!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Queue**: A queue follows the FIFO principle (First In First Out), where data is added to one end and removed from the other. This means that when a new element arrives, it goes at the front of the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: Picture waiting for your turn at a bank - you join behind others who arrived before you!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Heap**: A heap stores elements in order based on their priority or value (like an emergency response system prioritizing calls by severity). This allows efficient retrieval and manipulation of data according to its importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: Imagine responding to emergencies like fires, medical issues, or accidents. The most critical ones get addressed first! \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Linked List**: A linked list is a sequence of nodes connected through pointers (like cars in line).\n",
      "\n",
      "These storage classes have different use cases:\n",
      "1. Stack for LIFO operations\n",
      "2. Queue for FIFO processes\n",
      "3. Heap priority-based Storage Class\n",
      "\n",
      "Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them essential tools for efficient data management!\n",
